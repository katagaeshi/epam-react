Epam react course

Used technologies:
- webpack for bundling
- babel for transpiling
- express as a server
- jest for unit tests
- nightwatch for e2e tests
- jss for styles
- redux as a state container
- flow for static type analysis
- immutable just to show that I can
- reselect to speed up slow actions
- storybook for hype

Known issues:
- Nightwatch does not kill chrome process at the end of the e2e tests
- if node_modules/immutable/dist/immutable.js.flow fails on 'flow' command just comment failing line:  
  // static of<T>(...values: T[]): IndexedSeq<T>;

- css markup looks weird like my memories about kindergarten
